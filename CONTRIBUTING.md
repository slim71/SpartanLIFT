I'm not sure when this will be publicly available, but **it will be**.

Spoiler: if you're reading this, it already is!

Since this is a project related to my **Master Thesis** in **Robotics and Automation Engineering**, I don't think I'll be changing it after the dissertation.
But *you never know*! Maybe this will be part of something else after that...

Anyway, I'm open to issues, questions and whatnot! 
I'm usually fairly available for discussions too, so feel free to get in touch if you need! :smile:

### A little notice about reusing the project
Fork it, use it, spread it, change it, if you will, but please remember this is licensed with an **Apache-2.0**! 

Also, I'd really appreciate it you could reference me and my project! :wink:
